# Read before getting started!!

First, read [src/main.rs](https://github.com/voluntas-io/engineering-challenge/blob/main/src/main.rs). Then, some background on this repo:

This repo uses the [FIX SBE standard](https://fixtrading.org/packages/simple-binary-encoding-technical-specification-v2-rc2/)
for writing binary messages. The rust code abstracts this away for you, and you can simply use the helpers, as demonstrated in `main.rs`.

### More background, in case you are curious!

FIX SBE is defined in XML, which I find extremely cumbersome to edit, especially
when updating schemas frequently. To solve this, I have also introduced some
helper code that takes our own custom YAML format, and turns it into FIX SBE
XML, which in turn is used to generate rust code to encode and decode the
messages. **You don't need to edit any of these files**. This explanation is
simply to help you understand the origins of the various files in this repo.

If you're curious to see the YAML schema, take a look at [challenge_orderbook.yaml](https://github.com/voluntas-io/engineering-challenge/blob/main/sbe_schemas/engineering_challenge/challenge_orderbook.yaml).
We also use a custom timestamp field, so that the Rust struct can use
`chrono::DateTime` in the generated struct, and in SBE schema, it is a uint64
representing the timestamp as the number of microseconds since unix epoch.
